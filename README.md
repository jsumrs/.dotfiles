## How-To
I use [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage my dotfiles.  
If you want to copy them to your system:

Switch to home:
`cd`

Clone the repo:
`git clone git@github.com:jsumrs/.dotfiles.git`

Navigate inside:
`cd .dotfiles`

Run GNU stow:
`stow . `

Congratulations! You setup my config. Stow is a wonderful tool combined with git.
